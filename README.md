### Initial Setup
To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

#### 1. Database download:
   - Go to google drive to download necessary csv files. The link is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g1TlG_zCqg9E3Yp5tOgkNMtuvdcOj_KN?usp=sharing. The files need to be downloaded are "restaurant_menus.csv", "restaurant_data_new.csv" and "categories.csv". Put all of these csv files into the "CSV_DATA" folder.
   - **Notice:** The csv files can be about 300 MB.

#### 2. Database Initialization (`db_init.py`):
   - This script sets up your database with necessary tables and initial data.
   - **Important:** The initialization process can take some time, so please be patient.

#### 3. Running the Application (`app.py`):
   - After setting up the database, run `app.py` to start the Flask web server.

### Project Structure
